In this project, we have created an image editing app using flutter
We have not used any pre made libraries for this purpose and its using
draggable tool of flutter

We have only used four additional API's.

We have used image_picker to select the image to edit, permission_handler to handle all the permissions to save the image, screenshot to take the snap of the image and image_gallery_saver to save the image to the gallery

I have learnt about lots of stuffs while doing this project from null safety and the life cycle of widgets
